**ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts**

This repository contains the Solidity code for ERC20 token and Vault contracts. These contracts are designed to provide a standard implementation of the ERC20 token interface and a secure vault for storing tokens.

### ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract provides a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions to transfer tokens between addresses, approve spending of tokens by another address, and check balances.

#### Features:
- **Standard Interface**: Implements the ERC20 standard interface, allowing seamless integration with wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts.
- **Transfer Functions**: Allows users to transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Approval Mechanism**: Enables users to approve other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Provides functions to check the token balance of an address.

### Vault Contract

The Vault contract provides a secure way to store ERC20 tokens. It implements access controls to ensure that only authorized addresses can deposit or withdraw tokens from the vault.

#### Features:
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized addresses can deposit or withdraw tokens from the vault.
- **Deposit Function**: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault.
- **Withdraw Function**: Allows users to withdraw ERC20 tokens from the vault.
- **Security Measures**: Implements security measures to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the vault.

### Getting Started

To deploy and interact with these contracts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: If any dependencies are required, ensure they are installed.
3. **Compile Contracts**: Use a Solidity compiler to compile the ERC20 token and Vault contracts.
4. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy the compiled contracts to an Ethereum blockchain network of your choice.
5. **Interact with Contracts**: Use a web3 provider or Ethereum client to interact with the deployed contracts, including transferring tokens and managing the vault.
